- Research Question

The big question that we’re trying to answer is: are the non-monetary variables reported by unprofitable companies actually helpful in predicting future revenue? Companies frequently choose to report unique measures when in their unprofitable stages in an attempt to show investors continue ‘growth.’ However, these user figures often show growth when neither the top nor bottom line of the company seems to signficantly improve. 

In order to answer this question, we’re going to look at both Uber and Lyft’s previous reported users active and subsequent revenues. By analyzing these figures, we hope to discover whether they accurately predict future revenue. We hypothesize that user figures, while they may tend to correlate somewhat with higher revenue, will provide a poor predictor of future revenue (or profitability) success.
